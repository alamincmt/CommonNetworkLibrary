# CommonNetworkLibrary
A very simple library to call GET and POST RESTful API services. 

# How to add this library to Android Studio projects 

**Step 1:** Add the JitPack repository to your build file
Add it in your root/project level build.gradle at the end of repositories:

    allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
  
  
**Step 2:** Add the dependency in your app level build.gradle build file. 

    dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.alamincmt:CommonNetworkLibrary:v1.0.0'
	}

**Sync your project to finish**
